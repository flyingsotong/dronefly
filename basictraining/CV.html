                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>My career has been dedicated to building systems and communities that thrive on the cusp of major technological shifts. As an entrepreneur with nearly three decades of experience in media, I've had the privilege of leading organizations through digital transformation, from running Asia's largest digital news operations at Yahoo to co-founding Splice Media to support the next generation of media startups.</p>
                <p>This journey has been guided by a core belief: that with the right training, tools, and community, individuals can achieve incredible things. Whether it's coaching media founders or developing new operational workflows, my focus has always been on creating clear, accessible pathways to success.</p>
                <p>My lifelong passion for aviation has evolved in parallel. As a certified pilot, I bring a deep, personal understanding of the principles of airmanship, safety, and regulatory responsibility. This isn't just a hobby; it's a discipline that shapes my approach to every new venture.</p>
                <p>It was at the intersection of these passions—for education, community-building, and aviation—that <strong>Dronefly.sg</strong> was born. I created it as a public resource to demystify Singapore's drone laws and promote a culture of safety and responsibility among pilots. The work we've done in supporting the education of the drone community is a natural extension of my professional experience and personal commitment to safe skies.</p>
                <p>As the Accountable Manager for the Dronefly.sg UABTO, I aim to combine my entrepreneurial experience in building robust systems with my dedication as an aviator to establish a training organization that is not only compliant but sets a new standard for excellence and safety in unmanned aviation.</p>

                            <p>The Splice story started with an irritation: that media wasn’t making the most of the arrival of the internet. We believe that a healthy, viable media ecosystem requires a broader definition of media, an obsessive focus on serving users’ needs, and monetary value from that service.</p>
