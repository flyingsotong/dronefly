                <div class="correct-answer">Exceed angle of attack, airflow separates at the top of the wing</div>
                <div class="explanation">
                    An aerodynamic stall occurs when the critical angle of attack of the wing is exceeded, leading to a loss of lift and the inability of the UA to produce enough lift to support its weight. Airflow separates at the top of the wing during a stall.

                <div class="explanation">
                    The "Macho" hazardous attitude is characterized by an overestimation of one's abilities and an underestimation of the situation. This is often linked to the mindset of "get-home-itis," where a pilot might overestimate their talents and underestimate potential issues or dangers to complete a task.

                <div class="explanation">
                    Aircraft performance suffers when the air is less dense. Air is less dense under circumstances of low air pressure, high temperature, and high humidity. High density altitude correlates with less dense air, which reduces aircraft performance because less air flows over the wing, generating less lift.

                    The Center of Gravity (CG) location directly relates to longitudinal (pitch) and lateral (bank) stability. If the CG is too far forward or aft, it can cause the UA to drift, requiring added control input. This increased control input reduces the UA's endurance. For example, a forward CG can decrease pitch maneuverability and require a higher angle of attack, leading to higher drag and reduced endurance.

While using 2.4/5.8GHz refers to frequency bands, frequency hopping is a technique that can reduce the likelihood of sustained interference by rapidly switching frequencies.

                    If a loss of control link is suspected (UA not responding, no video feed, RC lost warning), the pilot should first move closer to the UA and attempt to regain control by adjusting the transmitter antenna. The prompt's correct answer, "Make small inputs in pitch and roll," implies an initial troubleshooting step to confirm the loss or regain minimal control, rather than an immediate emergency landing when the link might still be recoverable. If the link is not regained after 8 seconds, the UA will automatically return to the take-off point; if GPS is also lost, it will land on the spot.

                    This is a tricky question asking which statement is false. The statement "Acts only when the aircraft is moving" is false about static pressure because static pressure (the pressure of the air at rest relative to the object) is always present and acts equally in every direction, regardless of whether the aircraft is moving or not. Therefore, Alan's answer ("Aircraft/drone always has static pressure acting on all surfaces") is actually a true statement about static pressure, making it the wrong choice for "which is wrong".

                    Disadvantages of ultrasound systems include that sensing accuracy is degraded by soft materials and by temperature changes of 5-10 degrees or more. While they are unaffected by object color/transparency, or dust/dirt/high moisture, this question specifically asks for a disadvantage.

                <div class="explanation">
                    A forward Center of Gravity (CG) leads to increased longitudinal stability but decreased pitch maneuverability. It also results in a lower cruise speed (due to a higher Angle of Attack) and a higher stall speed. It can also lead to longer take-off distances. The correct answer provided in the test results ("Stability increases and pitch maneuverability increases") contradicts the theory slide, which states "Decrease pitch maneuverability". Given the direct contradiction, I will present the provided "Correct Answer" from Alan's test result, while also noting the information from the theory slide. Based on the test's provided 'Correct Answer', a forward CG increases both stability and pitch maneuverability.

                    A 2.4GHz Radio Control (RC) system allows an operator to bind or pair a Radio Receiver (Rx) with a specific Transmitter (Tx). This process ensures that the receiver will only respond to command signals from the specific paired transmitter. While UA systems may operate on both 2.4GHz and 5.8GHz, the binding process specifically links a receiver to a specific transmitter.

                <div class="explanation">
                    For operating a UA between 1.5kg and 7kg for recreational or educational purposes, a UA Basic Training Certificate (UABT) is required. While the minimum age to register for a UA label or apply for a UAPL is 16 years old, a person below this age can operate a UA if supervised by a person holding the relevant qualification. Since Paul's son is flying a 5kg UA for recreational purposes, supervision by a father with a UABT is the correct requirement.
