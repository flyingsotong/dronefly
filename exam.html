                    For operating a UA between 1.5kg and 7kg for recreational or educational purposes, a UA Basic Training Certificate (UABT) is required. While the minimum age to register for a UA label or apply for a UAPL is 16 years old, a person below this age can operate a UA if supervised by a person holding the relevant qualification. Since Paul's son is flying a 5kg UA for recreational purposes, supervision by a father with a UABT is the correct requirement.

                <div class="explanation">
                    An aerodynamic stall occurs when the critical angle of attack of the wing is exceeded, leading to a loss of lift and the inability of the UA to produce enough lift to support its weight. Airflow separates at the top of the wing during a stall.

                <div class="correct-answer">High density altitude</div>
                <div class="explanation">
                    Aircraft performance suffers when the air is less dense. Air is less dense under circumstances of low air pressure, high temperature, and high humidity. High density altitude correlates with less dense air, which reduces aircraft performance because less air flows over the wing, generating less lift.

                <div class="explanation">
                    To increase forward speed or accelerate, thrust must be greater than drag. "Powered-lift" aircraft are heavier-than-air aircraft capable of vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) and low-speed flight, relying on engine-driven lift devices or thrust for lift during these regimes, and non-rotating aerofoils for horizontal flight.

                <div class="correct-answer">Endurance of UA will reduce as more input is required</div>
                <div class="explanation">
                    The Center of Gravity (CG) location directly relates to longitudinal (pitch) and lateral (bank) stability. If the CG is too far forward or aft, it can cause the UA to drift, requiring added control input. This increased control input reduces the UA's endurance. For example, a forward CG can decrease pitch maneuverability and require a higher angle of attack, leading to higher drag and reduced endurance.

                <div class="explanation">
                    In high air density locations, more air flows over the wing, allowing the aircraft to generate more lift, thus improving aircraft performance. High air density is generally associated with low temperature, high air pressure, low humidity, and low altitude.

                <div class="explanation">
                    A forward Center of Gravity (CG) leads to increased longitudinal stability but decreased pitch maneuverability. It also results in a lower cruise speed (due to a higher Angle of Attack) and a higher stall speed. It can also lead to longer take-off distances. The correct answer provided in the test results ("Stability increases and pitch maneuverability increases") contradicts the theory slide, which states "Decrease pitch maneuverability". Given the direct contradiction, I will present the provided "Correct Answer" from Alan's test result, while also noting the information from the theory slide. Based on the test's provided 'Correct Answer', a forward CG increases both stability and pitch maneuverability.

                    Ground effect occurs when the wing or multi-rotor gets close to the ground, specifically less than one-half the wingspan above the ground. This reduces drag and can make an aircraft appear cushioned or buoyed during landing.

                    Frequency interference can be reduced by using spread spectrum technologies like FHSS (Frequency Hopping Spread Spectrum) or DSSS (Direct Sequence Spread Spectrum).

                <div class="explanation">
                    Headless mode (also called care-free mode) helps fix orientation problems by making the controls relative to the pilot's position rather than the aircraft's nose direction. In this mode, pushing the stick forward always moves the aircraft away from the pilot, regardless of which way the nose is pointing.

                <div class="explanation">
                    The statement "Static pressure increases with altitude" is incorrect. Static pressure actually decreases with altitude. As you go higher in the atmosphere, there is less air above pressing down, so the atmospheric pressure decreases. This is why altimeters work - they measure the decrease in static pressure to determine altitude.

                <div class="explanation">
                    Ultrasound systems have limited range as a significant disadvantage. They typically work effectively only at very close distances (usually a few meters) and can be affected by environmental factors like wind, temperature, and surface texture. They are commonly used for precision landing and low-altitude hovering but are not suitable for long-range applications.

                    An accelerometer can detect vibrations experienced by a UA by measuring changes in acceleration along different axes. When the aircraft vibrates, it experiences rapid changes in acceleration that the accelerometer can detect and measure, making it useful for monitoring aircraft health and detecting mechanical issues.

DECIDE stands for: Detect (the problem), Estimate (significance), Choose (course of action), Identify (best alternative), Do (take action), and Evaluate (monitor the solution). This systematic approach helps pilots make better decisions under pressure.
